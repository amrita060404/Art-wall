# 🎨 Amrita's Digital Art Wall 🖼️

*"When hostel walls become your canvas, but you must move on..."* ✨

## 🌟 The Story Behind This Project

For **3 magical years** in my hostel, I created something special - **an art wall behind my bed** that became:
- My creative sanctuary 🧘‍♀️  
- A conversation starter 💬  
- An (unofficial) hostel attraction 🏛️✨  
*(Though the authorities weren't as impressed as my friends!)*

Now as I **move on to new adventures**, I couldn't bear to leave these memories behind. So I built this **digital gallery** to preserve every brushstroke, doodle, and happy accident!
